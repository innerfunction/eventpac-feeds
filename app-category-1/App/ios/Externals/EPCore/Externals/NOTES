1. Plausible Database:

The version of Plausible Database currently included in this project has been downloaded from https://github.com/plausiblelabs/pldatabase
    (* branch pldatabase-1.2)

For this to compile, the setting '-DPL_DB_PRIVATE=1' has to be added to the EPCore target under 'Apple LLVM 5.1 - Custom Compile Flags' / 'Other C Flags'
(This was deduced from examining the Xcode project settings from the Github repo).

IMPORTANT: Note the custom modifications to the lib in this commit: https://github.com/innerfunction/EPCore/commit/9e96f080b354e29fc9d7e464881ecbbcddb82f9d

The '-fno-objc-arc' compiler flag is needed for all PL DB source files.

PLSqliteUnlockNotify.m: The iOS version of SQLite doesn't provide DB locking, and this class causes linker errors because of calls to sqlite3_unlock_notify; so I've replaced this class with a stub version without the unlocking calls. Original version is in PLSqliteUnlockNotify.m.original
